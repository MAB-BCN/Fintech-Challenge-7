In this Challenge, we created a financial database and web application using SQL, Python and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of an ETF that included 4 stocks. 

Each stock has its own table in the database labeled "etf.db", as shown in the following picture:

Using hvPlot, we created an interactive visualization for the stock PYPL daily returns and cumulative returns, as shown in the following pictures:

We then used the average daily returns of the ETF portfolio, to calculate the cumulative returns of the entire ETF portfolio, and using hvPlot we created an interactive plot to visualize the cumulative returns values of the ETF portfolio:

Finally, we used Voila to convert the code to HTML, as seen in the following screen recording:
